This program makes use of a bloom filter to create a firewall that filters out and flags certain words that are specified as illegal. This is done by using a bloom filter, hash tables, linked lists, bitvectors, nodes, and various other ADTs. The program outputs all occurrences of a transgression as well as a message regarding the user's crimes, and reads in 2 text files which need to be in the current working directory called badspeak.txt and newspeak.txt, these files contain the illegal words that the program should filter out. The program can be built running the make, make all, or make banhammer command from the command line with all the necessary files in the current working directory. Once the program is compiled you can run the executable by doing ./banhammer < "input file path" from the command line. The program also supports the following command line options: -h: program usage and help, -s: print program statistics, -m: enable move-to-front rule, -t size: specify hash table size (default: 10000), -f size: specify Bloom filter size (default: 2^20).
